# Implemantation of I-House Inventory Management

This project was bootstrapped with [ React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task Description

I-House is an open-source Inventory Management System which provides powerful low-level stock control. The core of the I-House system is a MongoDB database backend which provides an admin interface (web-based) and a REST API for interaction with external interfaces and applications.

I-House is designed to be lightweight and easy to use for SME or hobbyist applications, where many existing stock management solutions are bloated and cumbersome to use. Updating stock is a single-action process and does not require a complex system of work orders or stock transactions.

Powerful business logic works in the background to ensure that stock tracking history is maintained, and users have ready access to stock level information.
